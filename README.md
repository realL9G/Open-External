## Introduction
This project is an educational resource focused on understanding external memory manipulation and process injection techniques in the context of Roblox security research. The primary goal of this software is to demonstrate how external programs can interact with a running Roblox process, including reading, writing, and modifying memory in a controlled, ethical, and research-driven manner.

## Disclaimer

This project is provided **strictly for educational and research purposes only**. The authors **do not encourage, support, or condone** the use of these techniques for **cheating, unauthorized software modification, or violating the Terms of Service of any application or game**.

‚ö†Ô∏è Using the knowledge from this repository in **unauthorized** ways **may be illegal** and could result in account bans, legal consequences, or other penalties. 

By using this repository, you agree that:
- The authors are **not responsible** for any misuse of this knowledge.
- You will use this project **only for ethical research and legal applications**.
- You accept full responsibility for any consequences that may arise from using the information provided.

üß™ This project is created by a **new developer in cheat development**, and as such, the methods used may not be the most optimized or secure. This source code is **not guaranteed to be bug-free** and should not be used in any official or production software.

üîπ **Please keep in mind:**
- The code is primarily intended for **learning and experimentation**.
- There may be **inefficient methods or potential security vulnerabilities**.
- Contributions and feedback are welcome to help improve the project.

## Memory Manipulation Techniques

## What This Project Does NOT Include
This project is an **open-source educational resource** designed to demonstrate **external memory manipulation and injection techniques** in the context of **Roblox security research**. While it provides insight into how memory manipulation works, it is **not a functional cheat** and **cannot be compiled for use in real-world scenarios**.

### üö´ **This Project Does NOT Include:**

- ‚ùå **Updated offsets, signatures, or memory addresses for Roblox** ‚Äì The code lacks necessary offsets, preventing it from functioning as a cheat.
- ‚ùå **Compiled binaries or ready-to-use executables** ‚Äì This project only provides source code for learning; it does not contain prebuilt cheats.
- ‚ùå **Anti-cheat bypass techniques** ‚Äì No bypasses for Roblox's anti-cheat system or other security measures are included.
- ‚ùå **Any form of server-side manipulation** ‚Äì The focus is solely on external memory interaction, not tampering with online game logic.
- ‚ùå **Any code designed to evade Roblox's Terms of Service** ‚Äì The project is meant for security research, not for violating platform policies.


## Contributions

This project is meant for educational research. Contributions are welcome, but any pull requests adding:
- Game-specific offsets

...will be rejected to comply with ethical guidelines.

## **Additional Resources**

### üìå Open-Source Repositories
- [IOCTL-Driver](https://github.com/paysonism/payson-ioctl-cheat-driver) ‚Äì A kernel-mode driver used for memory manipulation in user-mode applications, demonstrating direct memory access techniques.
- [Kd-Mapper](https://github.com/TheCruZ/kdmapper) ‚Äì A widely used Driver Mapper that allows unsigned drivers to be loaded into kernel mode. This repository was modified and used as an example.

### üìå Debugging & Reverse Engineering Tools
- [Reclass.NET](https://github.com/ReClassNET/ReClass.NET) - A powerful open-source memory editing tool for Windows, designed to help reverse engineers analyze and visualize memory structures of running processes.
- [Process Hacker](https://processhacker.sourceforge.io/) ‚Äì An advanced system monitoring tool that allows users to inspect running processes and analyze system behavior in real-time.
